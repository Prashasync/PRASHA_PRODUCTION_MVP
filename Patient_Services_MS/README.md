## ðŸ›  Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to manage configuration:

```env
# Environment
NODE_ENV=
PORT=7001

# DB
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=
DB_HOST=

# Twilio
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
TWILIO_PHONE=

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=

# Email OTP settings
EMAIL_FROM=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=

```

Use a package like `dotenv` to load these variables in `app.js`:

```js
require("dotenv").config();
```

## ðŸ’¡ Debugging

If using `npm run dev`, it runs the app with:

```bash
nodemon app.js --inspect
```

This allows debugging using Chrome DevTools or other supported debuggers.
